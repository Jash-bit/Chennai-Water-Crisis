# Chennai-Water-Crisis
Chennai also known as Madras is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India.

This dataset has details about the water availability in the four main reservoirs over the last 15 years

Poondi
Cholavaram
Redhills
Chembarambakkam

The idea is to see if we can use this dataset to

1.Visualize the water need / usage of the city
2.Identify whether the water sources availability will be able to meet the needs till the subsequent monsoon?
3,How bad is the current water crisis compared to previous years?
